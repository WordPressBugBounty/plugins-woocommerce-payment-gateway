Accept all major credit cards directly on your WooCommerce site via this seamless and secure WooCommerce gateway.

== Description ==

Inspire Commerce is the all-in-one solution that allows you to turn your beautiful WooCommerce backed shopping experience into a selling machine.  This WooCommerce gateway plugin, combined with a [merchant account](http://www.inspirecommerce.com/woocommerce/ "merchant account") from Inspire Commerce, will allow you to accept transactions from all major credit cards including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, and JCB.

Using Inspire Commerce's innovative and secure [.pay™ developer framework](http://www.getdotpay.com ".pay"), this plugin supports both card storage as well as integration with the WooCommerce subscriptions module.  Inspire Commerce meets the highest standards of security and reliability and is PCI Level 1 compliant.

= For US Based Merchants =
You will need to setup a [credit card processing account with Inspire Commerce](http://www.inspirecommerce.com/woocommerce/ "credit card processing account with Inspire Commerce").  This account will allow you to accept payments from anyone in the world using all major card brands.  There is no processing minimum volume for US based merchants.  Account setup typically takes two to three business days.  Details are available on the [Inspire Commerce website](http://www.inspirecommerce.com/woocommerce/ "Inspire Commerce website").

= For Merchants outside of the US =
At this time, because of the complexity of international credit card processing, we are only accepting applicants for merchants that process over $40,000 USD per month for the WooCommerce Payment Gateway.  We can handle processing in most currencies throughout the world, but do require European business registration in most cases.  Please contact [Inspire Commerce](http://www.inspirecommerce.com/contact-us/ "Inspire Commerce") for more information.

== Screenshots ==

1. Easily accept credit card payments on your own branded page.

2. Here is a close up of the payment form as seen by your customers (it is fully editable and already branded to perfection for all WooThemes.com themes).  Notice that advanced features such as saving credit cards securely via the Inspire Commerce card vault are available if you choose to activate them in the admin area.  The module even works flawlessly with the WooCommerce subscriptions module.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a merchant account before I can use the Inspire Commerce gateway plugin? =
Yes.  In order to use this plugin you will need a merchant services account.  Inspire Commerce offers merchant accounts. For more information, please visit: http://www.inspirecommerce.com. If you already have a merchant account set up, chances are our gateway will integrate with it.  Send us an email: support@inspirecommerce.com or call our office: 800-261-3173 to find out more.

= What is the cost for the gateway plugin? =
This plugin is a FREE download, however it does have monthly and per transaction costs.  The gateway is $10/month plus $0.10 per transaction for the basic gateway features.  We do also offer value added features for an additional fee.  For more information: support@inspirecommerce.com

= Inspire Commerce is not showing up as a payment method - help! =
For security purposes, this plugin requires an active SSL connection via a secure https page to view this option on your payment pages.

= Does the plugin work with the WooCommerce subscription extension? =
Yes.  It works as long as the card vault functionality is activated in the gateway, and is turned on inside the WooCommerce payment gateways settings for Inspire Commerce.
